# A Tailwind CSS implementation in Go (wip, check back in a week or two)

(Planned) Features:

- Command Line
- Test server for prototyping
- Pure Go library, no npm/node dependency
- HTTP Handler
- Purge functionality to minimize output file size
- Can produce .go output for embedding

## Typical Usage

(show small standalone Go program with HTTP handler, compression and purging)

## In Production

(recommend just using static files in production - hmm, what about file hashes and such...)

## Supported Tailwind CSS Directives

## Command Line

### Processing CSS Files

### Test Server

## Library Usage

### Embedded TailwindCSS

## HTTP Handler

### Compression

### Caching

## Purging

(reduce file size)

### Purging: Scanning + Checking Approach

(a bit more work to setup and use, but more efficient and gives the same results in dev and production)

### Purging: Automatic

(less work to setup and maintain but runs slower)

## Embedding in Go Code
